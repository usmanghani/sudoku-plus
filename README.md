This is the first time I have tried to write professional quality code in java. I am not very familiar with the toolset in question. If you run into problems, please get back to me. I have made and tested this on a Mac OS X Mountain Lion machine with Eclipse Indigo and IntelliJ Community Edition installed. Part of the work was done in IntelliJ, and part in Eclipse.

Thanks,
Usman
